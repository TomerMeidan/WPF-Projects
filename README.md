## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured learning path for mastering WPF and to serve as a reference for implementing various WPF concepts in real-world applications. Each project is designed to build upon the previous one, gradually introducing more advanced topics and techniques.

## Project Descriptions

### Stage 1: Introduction to WPF - Simple Calculator
Create a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### Stage 2: Basic Concepts - Personal Contacts Manager
Develop a simple contacts manager application that allows users to add, view, and delete personal contacts.

### Stage 3: Intermediate Concepts - To-Do List Application
Create a to-do list application where users can add, edit, and remove tasks. Tasks should be displayed in a list and categorized.

### Stage 4: Data Binding and MVVM - Expense Tracker
Develop an expense tracker application where users can log their expenses, categorize them, and view summaries.

### Stage 5: Advanced Topics - Weather Dashboard
Build a weather dashboard application that displays current weather conditions, forecasts, and historical data.

### Stage 6: Performance Optimization - Image Gallery
Create an image gallery application that allows users to browse, search, and view images.

### Stage 7: Advanced UI Design - Music Player
Develop a music player application with features like playlist management, audio playback, and visualizations.

### Stage 8: Project Development - Full-Fledged WPF Application
Build a comprehensive WPF application of your choice (e.g., a project management tool, an e-commerce application, or a social media dashboard) that incorporates all the concepts learned.

## Goals

- Master the basics of WPF and XAML.
- Understand and implement data binding and MVVM patterns.
- Learn to create responsive and performance-optimized WPF applications.
- Explore advanced UI design techniques and custom controls.
- Develop a full-fledged WPF application applying best practices and design patterns.

Feel free to explore the projects and follow along with my WPF learning journey. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
